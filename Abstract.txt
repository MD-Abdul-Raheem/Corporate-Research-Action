PROJECT ABSTRACT: ACTIONALYZE
================================================================================
Corporate Action Tracking & AI-Driven Market Analysis Platform
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actionalyze is a professional fintech web application designed to track corporate stock actions—such as dividends, stock splits, and mergers—and analyze their potential market impact. By integrating real-time financial data with Generative AI, the platform transforms raw market events into actionable, human-readable insights for investors.

The application functions as a comprehensive dashboard where users can monitor market movers, visualize historical price performance, manage custom alerts, and generate AI-powered reports on financial health and sentiment.

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application utilizes a Client-Side Rendering (CSR) architecture built on React, emphasizing modularity, performance, and seamless user interaction.

[ Frontend Layer ]
    |
    +-- View Controllers (Pages): Manages route-specific logic and layout.
    +-- UI Components: Reusable, accessible interface elements (ShadCN-inspired).
    +-- State Management: React Hooks for local state and data persistence.

[ Service Layer ]
    |
    +-- Data Service (Hybrid Engine): 
    |     - Primary: Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API for live market data.
    |     - Secondary: Deterministic Mock Engine for robust offline/demo capabilities.
    |
    +-- AI Service (Gemini Integration):
          - Text Generation: Analyzes corporate actions for sentiment and impact.
          - Image Generation: Creates visual market summaries.

3. CORE FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. INTELLIGENT DASHBOARD
   - Market Movers: Real-time visualization of top performing stocks with sector tags.
   - Action Feed: Chronological stream of corporate events (Dividends, Splits, M&A).
   - Smart Search: Debounced autocomplete search traversing a database of 100+ major US assets.
   - Status Indicators: Visual feedback for Live API vs. Simulation modes.

B. ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS (Company Details)
   - Interactive Charting: Recharts-powered area charts with dynamic time ranges (1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y).
   - Genkit Financial Analyst: AI module that ingests market context to produce structured impact reports (e.g., Yield Sustainability, Price Outlook).
   - Visual Synthesis: On-demand generation of professional financial infographics.

C. ALERT MANAGEMENT system
   - Custom Triggers: Supports Price Targets (>$200) and Event Types (Dividend Announcements).
   - Lifecycle Management: Create, Pause, Activate, and Delete alerts.
   - Summary Dashboard: Metrics for Total, Active, and Paused alerts.

4. TECHNOLOGY STACK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Language:       TypeScript 5.x (Strict Mode)
* Framework:      React 19.x (Functional Components, Hooks)
* Routing:        React Router DOM
* Styling:        Tailwind CSS (Theme: Emerald Professional)
* Visualization:  Recharts (SVG-based D3 wrapper)
* AI/LLM:         Google GenAI SDK (Gemini 2.5 Flash & Flash Image)
* Data Provider:  Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)

5. DATA STRATEGY & ALGORITHMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application employs a "Graceful Degradation" strategy for data retrieval:

1. Hybrid Data Engine:
   - The system first attempts to fetch data via the FMP API using a stored key.
   - Upon failure or missing key, it falls back to a high-fidelity Mock Engine.
   - The Mock Engine uses a "Seeded Randomness" algorithm (Linear Congruential Generator) based on stock tickers. This ensures that simulated prices, charts, and dates remain consistent across sessions, providing a stable demo experience.

2. Context-Aware Prompt Engineering:
   - The AI Service dynamically constructs prompts based on the Action Type.
   - Example: If analyzing a 'Dividend', the system injects specific instructions to evaluate "Yield Attractiveness" and "Payout Ratio Sustainability," whereas a 'Merger' triggers instructions regarding "Synergies" and "Regulatory Risk."
